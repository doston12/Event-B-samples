Train 001 - SUICA Card in Tokyo Metro line
What is SUICA?
As contactless cash cards (IC Cards) increasingly become the norm, many people will opt to get a hassle-free card rather than buy a ticket for each ride. The "SUICA Card" is often at the top of search results for Tokyo transit cards. "SUICA" is an endearing Japanese pun on the word “watermelon” and “transit card.”  
The SUICA Card is sold by the Japan Rail (JR) East Company and can be used for all JR East trains, the Tokyo Metro, Toei Subway, buses, and monorail lines. The card can also be used for parts of Sendai, Niigata, Hokkaido, Tokaido, West Japan and Kyushu. The SUICA only works if your entry and exit point accepts SUICA cards, which is the case for all stations in Tokyo. This is our case; we are considering a solution for only within Tokyo metro line. 


How to use suica card in metro? 
When entering the train station, use your Suica card and tap your card at the reader on the ticket gate. Do the same when leaving the station. Tap your IC card on top of the sensor at the gate and walk through when they open. If the card you are using has no money left, the light will flash red, and you will first need to recharge your card. If you have traveled outside the route covered by your commuter pass an additional fee will be deducted. If there is not enough balance on your card you will have to charge it at a fare adjustment machine.
•	Simply touch the Suica card to the reader at the ticket gate when out and about. There is no need to purchase a ticket from a vending machine. 
•	The fare is automatically calculated at the station where you get off. 
•	When you get off the train, the fare will be calculated at that station. 
•	If the balance is insufficient, however, you will need to add more money to your Suica.
Before we start, make sure to know whether you’re traveling by subway or JR train. They’re different lines, and so different stops will be available. JR stations will always have the JR symbol above them, and local metros/subways will differ depending on the city. Upon arrival at a station, it’s important to read the signs. Luckily, most everything will also be in English unless at a very small station. Again, remember that if you arrived at a station by subway and want to hop on a JR line, you’ll need to first exit the metro by inserting your ticket or IC card through a ticket gate, then following signs towards the JR lines in order to transfer.

Some information about travelling in Tokyo metro line.
You need one Suica PER PERSON, just like you need a ticket for every person. Children under the age of 6 ride of free, just get them through the gate when you are passing. Two children per adult are allowed for free and you will have to pay for reserved seats. Older children from 6 to 11 years of age get a special children Suica card, which you have to get at one of the counters at the train station. Fares for that age are about half the price of a fare for adult. For ages 12 and up you need a regular Suica card.
